# blog_application
Simple interactive website that allows users to read/write and edit an online blog. It features a secured login for users to access their blogs and the blogs of other users. This application ran on the Cloud 9 service using both Apache2 and MySql for execution. Below are screenshots of my project.

Screenshot of the database used for this blog application. I used MySql to store username, passwords, and text within a user's blog. 

Ongoing Improvements: Improvements will be made to the styling of the website. I might use HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and possibly Bootstrap for styling improvements.
Another Improvement: Adding encryption to stored passwords. As seen above, the passwords are not encrypted for the sake of showing how the database worked with the project. Encryptions protocols may be added later on.
